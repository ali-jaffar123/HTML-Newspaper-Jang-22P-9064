## Project Description
This project recreates the front page of Daily Jang during the 1971 Indo-Pak war using only HTML. 
The layout uses semantic HTML5 tags and a table-based column structure 
to resemble the original newspaper.

## Features Implemented
- Proper HTML5 document structure
- Semantic tags (header, nav, section, article, footer)
- 3-column table layout
- Heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, h4)
- List (ul)
- Inline styling
- Alt attributes for images

## Challenges Faced
Recreating a newspaper layout without external CSS was challenging. 
I used tables carefully to maintain column alignment and structure.
